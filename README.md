# seemantic

## Installation

You will need:
* nvm
* uv (with python 3.12)

## Principles

* No vendor lock-in:
    * 100% Open-source (no open-core)
    * Easily self-hostable (CPU-only server + Postgres DB)
    * Data is on user hardware
* Production-ready for enterprise
    * End-to-end solution (UI, storage)
    * Scalable
    * Secure (authentication, encryption, rights management)
    * Collaborative
* Pragmatic: deliver the expected result, no AI-magic or purity.

## MVP Specifications

* A docker-compose command to setup the service
* Ask a question, get an answer with references
* add / remove files
* Ability to update without loosing data
* Works for pdf, md, docx (only text)
* Local conversation history
* Compatible with Mistral API


## Tech stack

Each componant with the following objectives in mind:
* Open-source
* Compatible with both self-hosting and cloud
* Scalable
* Multi-tenant compatible
* Standard
* Cost-efficient
* Without vendor lock-in

### Storage
* Documents storage: S3-compatible (self-hosted MinIO by default).
* Application Database: Postgres.
* vector database: lanceDB.
* Conversation history: Postgres?


### backend
* Web server: FastAPI.
* Indexing: Python worker
* Authentication: Zitadel
* Right management: ?
* Encryption: ?

### frontend
* Purely local (compatible with CDN)
* Vite
* Tanstack router
* React
* Dexie

## Security:

* Each tier (or subspace) has a symmetric key
* Each user has a asymmetric key derived from their password
* For each user, we store the symmetric key encrypted with their public asymetric key
* When a user make a request, he send a derived version of its password (after being authenticated, see ZKP, PAKE), this derivate key is used to get the assymetric private key to decrypt the symmetric key
* This symmetric key is never stored, so no-one can access the data (even platform owner)
* See Shamirâ€™s Secret Sharing (SSS) for recovery
